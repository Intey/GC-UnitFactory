# GC-UnitFactory
__Python scripts for simplify creation of GTest+CMake units__

Our team use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) for build, and [GTest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest) for testing.
We create one test unit(cmake project) for each module, so generating new unit become pain in ass. 
So, becouse i like to spend many days in creating script, that solve task in seconds(when manual solving may take 5 minutes),
i try to write sowe funny, easy script for creating unit test.
